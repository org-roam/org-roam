;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides the necessary changes required to make org-export work out-of-the-box.
;;
;; To enable it, run:
;;
;;    (require 'org-roam-export)
;;
;; The key issue Org's export-to-html functionality has is that it does not respect the ID property, which
;; Org-roam relies heavily on. This patches the necessary function in ox-html to export ID links correctly,
;; pointing to the correct place.
;;
;;; Code:
(require 'ox-html)
