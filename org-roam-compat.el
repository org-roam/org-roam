  "Return list of all files under directory DIR whose names match REGEXP.
This function works recursively.  Files are returned in \"depth
first\" order, and files from each directory are sorted in
alphabetical order.  Each file name appears in the returned list
in its absolute form.

By default, the returned list excludes directories, but if
optional argument INCLUDE-DIRECTORIES is non-nil, they are
included.

PREDICATE can be either nil (which means that all subdirectories
of DIR are descended into), t (which means that subdirectories that
can't be read are ignored), or a function (which is called with
the name of each subdirectory, and should return non-nil if the
subdirectory is to be descended into).

If FOLLOW-SYMLINKS is non-nil, symbolic links that point to
directories are followed.  Note that this can lead to infinite
recursion."
