### Breaking

  ```emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-node-display-template

- [#1252](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1252) respect original link type during automatic replacement

## 1.2.2 (06-10-2020)

In this release we support fuzzy links of the form `[[roam:Title]]`, `[[roam:*Headline]]` and `[[roam:Title*Headline]]`. Completion for these fuzzy links is supported via `completion-at-point`.

Org-roam now does not resolve symlinks. This significantly speeds up cache builds, but may result in some workflows breaking. In particular, Org-roam now cannot figure out if two distinct file paths in the Org-roam directory are the same file, and both files will be processed as if they were different files. This error seems to be unavoidable now that symlinks are not resolved, but this workflow is rare and should not affect most users.

This change requires you to set `org-roam-directory` to the resolved path of a folder. That is:

```elisp
(setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "/path/to/directory/"))
```

### Breaking Changes

- [#910](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/910) Deprecate `company-org-roam`, using `completion-at-point` instead. To use this with company, add the `company-capf` backend instead.
- [#1109](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/1109) Org-roam now does not resolve symlinks.

- [#1103](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/1103) Fix long build-times for Windows on files with URL links

## 1.2.1 (27-07-2020)

This release consisted of a big deal of refactoring and bug fixes. Notably, we fixed several catastrophic failures on db builds with bad setups (#854), and modularized tag and title extractions.

We also added some new features that had been a long time coming:

1. We made the backlinks more outline-friendly by also showing the outline hierarchy for a backlink (#863)
2. We now support nested captures, which is crucial for `org-roam-protocol` (#966)

### Breaking Changes

- [#908](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/908) Normalized titles in database. May break external packages that rely on unnormalized titles.

- [#851](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/851) Add `'first-directory'` option for `org-roam-tag-sources`

### Bugfixes

- [#857](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/857) Fix tag extraction for symlinked directories.
- [#894](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/894) Perform link fixes on all Org-roam files
- [#952](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/952) Cache `${foo}` template variables so they do not need to be re-entered twice

## 1.2.0 (12-06-2020)

In this release, we improved the linking process by achieving feature parity between links to files and links to headlines. Before, we used the `file:foo::*bar` format to link to the headline `bar` in file `foo`, but this was prone to breakage upon renaming the file or modifying the headline. This is not the case anymore. Now, we use `org-id` to create IDs for those headlines, which are then stored in our database to compute the relationships and jump around. Note that this will work even if you’re not using `org-id` in your global configuration for Org-mode.

This is a major step forward. Supporting the in-file structure of Org-mode files means that we can interface with many of its core-features like TODOs, properties, priorities, etc. UX will have to be figured out, but this release ushers in a new age in terms of functionalities.

We also add `org-roam-unlinked-references`, which naively finds text that could be references to the current Org-roam file.

### Breaking Changes

- [#701](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/701) Use `emacsql-sqlite3` instead of `emacsql-sqlite` for better Windows compatibility. This requires the presence of the standard `sqlite3` binary on your machine.
- [#750](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/750) Deprecate `org-roam-buffer-no-delete-other-windows` in favour of `org-roam-buffer-window-parameters`.

## 1.1.1 (18-05-2020)

In this release, we added two new features:

1. `org-roam-doctor`: a linting system that helps you discover possible problems with your Org-roam files. This is in the spirit of keeping notes in top quality.
2. A tagging system: one can now use sub-directories, and the `#+roam_tags` key add additional meta data to notes. For more information, see [here](https://www.orgroam.com/manual/Tags.html#Tags).

As usual, this release comes with a multitude of bug-fixes and refactorings.

## 1.1.0 (21-04-2020)

To the average user, this release is mainly a bugfix release with additional options to customize. However, the changes made to the source is significant. Most notably, in this release:

1. The codebase has been modularized into separate files, to ease future maintenance and adding of new features (mainly by [@progfolio](https://github.com/progfolio)). Because of these changes, we had to rename many functions and variables: the old names are kept for backwards compatibility, but you are encouraged to use the new function names. You'll receive a warning when you're calling the function with its obsolete name.
2. [@kljohann](https://github.com/kljohann) did some fantastic work on graph generation: allowing building images for connected components within the graph up to a specified distance
3. We also started supporting `org-ref` natively: cite links now show up in both the graph and the org-roam buffer.

In the coming months, you can expect work on bigger projects (e.g. revamping the org-roam buffer).

### Breaking Changes
