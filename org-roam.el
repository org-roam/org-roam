;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Org-roam is a Roam Research inspired Emacs package and is an addition to
;; Org-mode to have a way to quickly process complex SQL-like queries over a
;; large set of plain text Org-mode files. To achieve this Org-roam provides a
;; database abstraction layer, the capabilities of which include, but are not
;; limited to:
;;
;; - Link graph traversal and visualization.
;; - Instantaneous SQL-like queries on headlines
;;   - What are my TODOs, scheduled for X, or due by Y?
;; - Accessing the properties of a node, such as its tags, refs, TODO state or
;;   priority.
;;
;; All of these functionality is powered by this layer. Hence, at its core
;; Org-roam's primary goal is to provide a resilient dual representation of
;; what's already available in plain text, while cached in a binary database,
;; that is cheap to maintain, easy to understand, and is as up-to-date as it
;; possibly can. For users who would like to perform arbitrary programmatic
;; queries on their Org files Org-roam also exposes an API to this database
;; abstraction layer.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; In order for the package to correctly work it's mandatory to add somewhere to
;; your configuration the next form:
;;
;;     (org-roam-setup)
;;
;; The form can be called both, before or after loading the package, which is up
;; to your preferences. If you call this before the package is loaded, then it
;; will automatically load the package.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This package also comes with a set of officially supported extensions that
;; provide extra features. You can find them in the "extensions/" subdirectory.
;; When `org-roam` is loaded, they are not loaded along, but they still will be
;; lazy-loaded through their own `autoload's.
;;
;; Org-roam also has other extensions that don't come together with the package
;; itself. Such extensions are distributed as their own packages, while also
;; authored and maintained by different people on distinct repositories. The
;; majority of them can be found at https://github.com/org-roam and MELPA.

It should be a list of symbols or cons cells representing any of the following
supported file search methods.

The commands will be tried in order until an executable for a command is found.
The Elisp implementation is used if no command in the list is found.

  `find'
    Use find as the file search method.
    Example command:
    find /path/to/dir -type f \( -name \"*.org\" -o -name \"*.org.gpg\" \)

  `fd'
    Use fd as the file search method.
    Example command: fd /path/to/dir/ --type file -e \".org\" -e \".org.gpg\"

  `fdfind'
    Same as `fd'. It's an alias that used in some OSes (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu)

  `rg'
    Use ripgrep as the file search method.
    Example command: rg /path/to/dir/ --files -g \"*.org\" -g \"*.org.gpg\"

By default, `executable-find' will be used to look up the path to the
executable. If a custom path is required, it can be specified together with the
method symbol as a cons cell. For example: '(find (rg . \"/path/to/rg\"))."
