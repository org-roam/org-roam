(defun org-roam-update-org-id-locations (&rest directories)
  "Scan Org-roam files to update `org-id' related state.
This is like `org-id-update-id-locations', but will automatically
use the currently bound `org-directory' and `org-roam-directory'
along with DIRECTORIES (if any), where the lookup for files in
these directories will be always recursive.

Note: Org-roam doesn't have hard dependency on
`org-id-locations-file' to lookup IDs for nodes that are stored
in the database, but it still tries to properly integrates with
`org-id'. This allows the user to cross-reference IDs outside of
the current `org-roam-directory', and also link with \"id:\"
links to headings/files within the current `org-roam-directory'
that are excluded from identification in Org-roam as
`org-roam-node's, e.g. with \"ROAM_EXCLUDE\" property."
