#+title: Test Case for org-roam-subtree-extract

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

This file will be copied to a =.org= file which will be altered by the extraction process.

* Node to be extracted
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: unique-id-2
:END:

Donec neque quam, dignissim in, mollis nec, sagittis eu, wisi.

This heading has an existing ID, so will be identified as an existing node.
* Heading without ID

Vivamus id enim.

This heading is not a node (no ID property), but should be converted to a node on extract.
* Extra heading
    This heading should stay put.
