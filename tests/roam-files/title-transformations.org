#+todo: IDEA | DONE
* A title with an [[https://gnu.org][embedded link]]
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       70451c3f-0bea-4f0a-8a8e-15d7fd133130
:END:
This can be used to test that the node title is transformed by =org-link-display-format=.

* Title linking to [[id:70451c3f-0bea-4f0a-8a8e-15d7fd133130][A title with an embedded link]]
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b15be55a-a8da-4ce5-8360-96b8eec6845b
:END:
This too, except that it's an ID-link that should still count for backlinks.

* IDEA [#A] [100%] A title with a TODO-state, priority and [10/10] multiple statistics-cookies [10/10]
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ca1a671f-5b08-4248-85aa-c91febba651f
:END:
Only the todo-state and priority are to be removed.

* TODO A title that appears on first glance to have a TODO-state
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2d4e00c3-3346-43b6-a421-e8147bd865c0
:END:
"TODO" isn't one of the words in the file-local =#+todo:= settings, so it should naturally stay part of the title, not be removed.

* A title with /italics/, *bold*, _underline_, +strikethrough+ and =monospace=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       35992759-8187-4f57-9721-a5b04df019b6
:END:
These are preserved.
