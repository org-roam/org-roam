- NOT IMPLEMENTED as of [2025-11-12 Wed]: the SCHEDULED-line should probably disappear upon promoting this heading into a file-level node, or at least move down to after the :PROPERTIES: drawer.  Otherwise Org thinks there are no properties and thus no file-level node!

- The =TODO [#A] [1/2]= is probably reasonable to leave to the user to fix up manually, if they so desire.
