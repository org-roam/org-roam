#+TITLE: Excluded by Org-roam

This node is excluded by declaring ~ROAM_EXCLUDE: t~.

* Another excluded node
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b2432fe5-0aab-4e1a-b83c-809a899a79f8
:END:

This should *in theory* be excluded due to inheriting the =ROAM_EXCLUDE= property...

However, it turns out that org-roam has probably never worked that way!  May be too late to change, then.

* Not excluded
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       295aa41a-4318-4b17-b98c-b2a9e85e4525
:ROAM_EXCLUDE: nil
:END:

This should not be excluded, due to overriding the inherited =ROAM_EXCLUDE= property to the magical string "nil", which Org interprets as the Lisp symbol =nil=.  See =org-entry-get=.

** Also not excluded
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0e02f465-0fd9-404c-b3bc-1138e9c0cdf2
:END:

** Excluded but without "t"
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       aa3b8409-e918-44af-8f2f-b4639f812573
:ROAM_EXCLUDE:
:END:

Technically, it doesn't have to be "t", just anything other than "nil".
