Org-roam is a plain-text knowledge management system. It brings some of
[Roam's][roamresearch] more powerful features into the [Org-mode][org]
ecosystem.

Org-roam borrows principles from the Zettelkasten method, providing a solution
for non-hierarchical note-taking. It should also work as a plug-and-play
solution for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

- **Private and Secure**: Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely
  in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG. Take lasting notes in
  plain-text.
- **Networked Thought**: Connect notes and thoughts together with ease using
  backlinks. Discover surprising and previously unseen connections in your notes
  with the built-in graph visualization.
- **Extensible and Powerful**: Leverage Emacs' fantastic text-editing interface,
  and the mature Emacs and Org-mode ecosystem of packages.
- **Free and Open Source**: Org-roam is licensed under the GNU General Public
  License version 3 or later.

## Installation

You can install `org-roam` using `package.el`:

```
M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
```

Here's a sample configuration with `use-package`:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package org-roam
      :ensure t
      :custom
      (org-roam-directory (file-truename "/path/to/org-files/"))
      :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle)
             ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find)
             ("C-c n g" . org-roam-graph)
             ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert)
             ("C-c n c" . org-roam-capture)
             ;; Dailies
             ("C-c n j" . org-roam-dailies-capture-today))
      :config
      (org-roam-setup)
      ;; If using org-roam-protocol
      (require 'org-roam-protocol))
```

The `file-truename` function is only necessary when you use symbolic links
inside `org-roam-directory`: Org-roam does not resolve symbolic links.

Org-roam requires sqlite to function. Org-roam optionally uses Graphviz for
graph-related functionality. It is recommended to install PCRE-enabled ripgrep
for better performance and extended functionality.
