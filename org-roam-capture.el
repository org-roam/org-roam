  "Templates for the creation of new entries within Org-roam.

Each entry is a list with the following items:

keys   The keys that will select the template, as a string, characters only, for
       example \"a\" for a template to be selected with a single key, or
       \"bt\" for selection with two keys. When using several keys, keys
       using the same prefix must be together in the list and preceded by a
       2-element entry explaining the prefix key, for example:

                   (\"b\" \"Templates for marking stuff to buy\")

       The \"C\" key is used by default for quick access to the customization of
       the template variable. But if you want to use that key for a template,
       you can.

description   A short string describing the template, which will be shown
              during selection.

type       The type of entry. Valid types are:
               entry       an Org node, with a headline.  Will be filed
                           as the child of the target entry or as a
                           top level entry.  Its default template is:
                             \"* %?\n %a\"
               item        a plain list item, will be placed in the
                           first plain list at the target location.
                           Its default template is:
                             \"- %?\"
               checkitem   a checkbox item.  This differs from the
                           plain list item only in so far as it uses a
                           different default template.  Its default
                           template is:
                             \"- [ ] %?\"
               table-line  a new line in the first table at target location.
                           Its default template is:
                             \"| %? |\"
               plain       text to be inserted as it is.

template     The template for creating the capture item.
             If it is an empty string or nil, a default template based on
             the entry type will be used (see the \"type\" section above).
             Instead of a string, this may also be one of:

                 (file \"/path/to/template-file\")
                 (function function-returning-the-template)

             in order to get a template from a file, or dynamically
             from a function.

The template contains a compulsory :target property. The :target property
contains a list, where:
  - The first element indicates the type of the target.
  - The second element indicates the location of the captured node.
  - And the rest of the list indicate the prefilled template, that will be
    inserted and the position of the point will be adjusted for.
    This behavior varies from type to type.

The following options are supported for the :target property:

   (file \"path/to/file\")
       The file will be created, and prescribed an ID.

   (file+head \"path/to/file\" \"head content\")
       The file will be created, prescribed an ID, and head content will be
       inserted if the node is a newly captured one.

   (file+olp \"path/to/file\" (\"h1\" \"h2\"))
       The file will be created, prescribed an ID. If the file doesn't contain
       the outline path (h1, h2), it will be automatically created. The point
       will be adjusted to the last element in the OLP.

   (file+head+olp \"path/to/file\" \"head content\" (\"h1\" \"h2\"))
       The file will be created, prescribed an ID. Head content will be
       inserted at the start of the file if the node is a newly captured one.
       If the file doesn't contain the outline path (h1, h2), it will be
       automatically created. The point will be adjusted to the last element in
       the OLP.

   (file+datetree \"path/to/file\" tree-type)
       The file will be created, prescribed an ID. A date based outline path
       will be created for today's date. The tree-type can be one of the
       following symbols: day, week or month. The point will adjusted to the
       last element in the tree. To prompt for date instead of using today's,
       use the :time-prompt property.

   (node \"title or alias or ID of an existing node\")
       The point will be placed for an existing node, based on either, its
       title, alias or ID.

The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.  Recognized
properties are:

 :prepend            Normally newly captured information will be appended at
                     the target location (last child, last table line,
                     last list item...).  Setting this property will
                     change that.

 :immediate-finish   When set, do not offer to edit the information, just
                     file it away immediately.  This makes sense if the
                     template only needs information that can be added
                     automatically.

 :jump-to-captured   When set, jump to the captured entry when finished.

 :empty-lines        Set this to the number of lines that should be inserted
                     before and after the new item.  Default 0, only common
                     other value is 1.

 :empty-lines-before Set this to the number of lines that should be inserted
                     before the new item.  Overrides :empty-lines for the
                     number lines inserted before.

 :empty-lines-after  Set this to the number of lines that should be inserted
                     after the new item.  Overrides :empty-lines for the
                     number of lines inserted after.

 :clock-in           Start the clock in this item.

 :clock-keep         Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.

 :clock-resume       Start the interrupted clock when finishing the capture.
                     Note that :clock-keep has precedence over :clock-resume.
                     When setting both to t, the current clock will run and
                     the previous one will not be resumed.

 :time-prompt        Prompt for a date/time to be used for date/week trees
                     and when filling the template.

 :tree-type          When `week', make a week tree instead of the month-day
                     tree.  When `month', make a month tree instead of the
                     month-day tree.

 :unnarrowed         Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the
                     full buffer.  Default is to narrow it so that you
                     only see the new stuff.

 :table-line-pos     Specification of the location in the table where the
                     new line should be inserted.  It should be a string like
                     \"II-3\", meaning that the new line should become the
                     third line before the second horizontal separator line.

 :kill-buffer        If the target file was not yet visited by a buffer when
                     capture was invoked, kill the buffer again after capture
                     is finalized.

 :no-save            Do not save the target file after finishing the capture.

The template defines the text to be inserted.  Often this is an
Org mode entry (so the first line should start with a star) that
will be filed as a child of the target headline.  It can also be
freely formatted text.  Furthermore, the following %-escapes will
be replaced with content and expanded:

  %[pathname] Insert the contents of the file given by
              `pathname'.  These placeholders are expanded at the very
              beginning of the process so they can be used to extend the
              current template.
  %(sexp)     Evaluate elisp `(sexp)' and replace it with the results.
              Only placeholders pre-existing within the template, or
              introduced with %[pathname] are expanded this way.  Since this
              happens after expanding non-interactive %-escapes, those can
              be used to fill the expression.
  %<...>      The result of `format-time-string' on the ... format
              specification.
  %t          Time stamp, date only.  The time stamp is the current time,
              except when called from agendas with `\\[org-agenda-capture]' or
              with `org-capture-use-agenda-date' set.
  %T          Time stamp as above, with date and time.
  %u, %U      Like the above, but inactive time stamps.
  %i          Initial content, copied from the active region.  If
              there is text before %i on the same line, such as
              indentation, and %i is not inside a %(sexp), that prefix
              will be added before every line in the inserted text.
  %a          Annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'.
  %A          Like %a, but prompt for the description part.
  %l          Like %a, but only insert the literal link.
  %L          Like %l, but without brackets (the link content itself).
  %c          Current kill ring head.
  %x          Content of the X clipboard.
  %k          Title of currently clocked task.
  %K          Link to currently clocked task.
  %n          User name (taken from the variable `user-full-name').
  %f          File visited by current buffer when `org-capture' was called.
  %F          Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.
  %:keyword   Specific information for certain link types, see below.
  %^g         Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
  %^G         Prompt for tags, with completion on all tags in all agenda files.
  %^t         Like %t, but prompt for date.  Similarly %^T, %^u, %^U.
              You may define a prompt like: %^{Please specify birthday}t.
              The default date is that of %t, see above.
  %^C         Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
  %^L         Like %^C, but insert as link.
  %^{prop}p   Prompt the user for a value for property `prop'.
              A default value can be specified like this:
              %^{prop|default}p.
  %^{prompt}  Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
              A default value and a completion table can be specified like this:
              %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3|...}.
  %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.
  %\\1 ... %\\N Insert the text entered at the nth %^{prompt}, where N
              is a number, starting from 1.

Apart from these general escapes, you can access information specific to
the link type that is created.  For example, calling `org-capture' in emails
or in Gnus will record the author and the subject of the message, which you
can access with \"%:from\" and \"%:subject\", respectively.  Here is a
complete list of what is recorded for each link type.

Link type               |  Available information
------------------------+------------------------------------------------------
bbdb                    |  %:type %:name %:company
vm, wl, mh, mew, rmail, |  %:type %:subject %:message-id
gnus                    |  %:from %:fromname %:fromaddress
                        |  %:to   %:toname   %:toaddress
                        |  %:fromto (either \"to NAME\" or \"from NAME\")
                        |  %:date %:date-timestamp (as active timestamp)
                        |  %:date-timestamp-inactive (as inactive timestamp)
gnus                    |  %:group, for messages also all email fields
eww, w3, w3m            |  %:type %:url
info                    |  %:type %:file %:node
calendar                |  %:type %:date

When you need to insert a literal percent sign in the template,
you can escape ambiguous cases with a backward slash, e.g., \\%i.

In addition to all of the above, Org-roam supports additional
substitutions within its templates. \"${foo}\" will look for the
foo property in the Org-roam node (see the `org-roam-node'). If
the property does not exist, the user will be prompted to fill in
the string value.

Org-roam templates are NOT compatible with regular Org capture:
they rely on additional hacks and hooks to achieve the
streamlined user experience in Org-roam."

(defvar org-roam-capture-preface-hook nil
  "Hook run when Org-roam tries to determine capture location of the node.
If any hook returns a value (which should be an ID), all hooks
after it are ignored.

With this hook you can hijack controls over the location of the
node for which the capture process is currently running for, or
use to just perform an arbitrary side effect, e.g. modify the
state related to the capture process. See `org-roam-protocol' and
`org-roam-dailies' as examples for what and how this hook is used
for.

If you're trying to perform the hijack, it's mandatory for you to:
  1. Set the currently active buffer for editing operations using
     `org-capture-target-buffer'.
  2. Place the point in this buffer from where the location starts
     from (e.g. if it's a file based node it should be the BOB,
     otherwise it should be the position from where the heading
     based node starts from).
  3. Return the ID (as a string) of the capturing node.

If you use this hook for any other purpose, but not the hijack,
it's mandatory that you should return nil as the return value; so
the capture process would be able to setup the capture buffer.

If you need to do something when you capture new nodes, use
`org-roam-capture-new-node-hook' instead of this hook.

WARNING: This hook is primarily designed for the usage by the
extensions and packages, and requires understanding of the
internal capture process. If you don't understand it, you should
learn these internals before using this or use it at your own
risk breaking things.")
