* Introduction

Org-roam is a tool for network thought. It reproduces some of [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam
Research's]] [fn:roam] features within the all-powerful [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]].

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking with
Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking fun and easy.
Org-roam keeps closely to Org syntax, and will work for anyone already using
Org-mode for their personal wiki.

Org-roam gains its superpowers by leveraging the mature ecosystem around
Org-mode. For example, it has first-class support for [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] for citation
management.

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

- *Privacy and Security:* Keep your personal wiki entirely offline and in your
  control. Encrypt your notes with GPG.
- *Longevity of Plain Text:* Unlike web solutions like Roam Research, the notes
  are first and foremost plain Org-mode files -- Org-roam simply builds an
  auxiliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes
  in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry
  about proprietary web solutions being taken down. The notes are still
  functional even if Org-roam ceases to exist.
- *Free and Open Source:* Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if
  you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam,
  or open a pull request.
- *Leverage the Org-mode ecosystem:* Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has
  developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon
  Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
- *Built on Emacs:* Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we
  can inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages
  available to Emacs.

* Target Audience

Org-roam is a tool that will appear unfriendly to anyone unfamiliar with Emacs
and Org-mode, but is also extremely powerful to those willing to put effort in
mastering the intricacies of the tools. Org-roam stands on the shoulders on
giants. Emacs was first created in 1976, and remains a top tier tool for editing
text and designing textual interfaces. The malleability of Emacs allowed the
creation of Org-mode, an all-purpose plain-text system for maintaining TODO
lists, planning projects, and authoring documents. Both of these tools are
incredibly vast and require significant time investment to master.

Org-roam assumes basic familiarity with these tools. It is not difficult to get
up and running with basic text-editing functionality, but one will only fully
appreciate the power of building Roam functionality into Emacs and Org-mode when
the usage of these tools become more advanced.

One key advantage to Org-roam is that building on top of Emacs gives it
malleability. This is especially important for note-taking workflows. It is our
belief that note-taking workflows are extremely personal, and there is no one
tool that's perfect for you. Org-mode and Org-roam allows you to discover what
works for you, and build that perfect tool for yourself.

If you are new to the software, and choose to take this leap of faith, I hope
you find yourself equally entranced as Neal Stephenson was.

* A Brief Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method

Org-roam provides utilities for maintaining a digital slip-box. This section
aims to provide a brief introduction to the "slip-box", or "Zettelkasten"
method. By providing some background on the method, we hope that the design
decisions of Org-roam will become clear, and that will aid in using Org-roam
appropriately. In this section we will introduce terms commonly used within the
Zettelkasten community and the Org-roam forums.

The Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It places heavy
emphasis on connecting ideas, building up a web of thought. Hence, it is well
suited for knowledge workers and intellectual tasks, such as conducting
research. The Zettelkasten can act as a research partner, where conversations
with it may produce new and surprising lines of thought.

This method is attributed to German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who using the
method had produced volumes of written works. Luhmann's slip-box was simply a
box of cards. These cards are small -- often only large enough to fit a single
concept. The size limitation encourages ideas to be broken down into individual
concepts. These ideas are explicitly linked together. The breakdown of ideas
encourages tangential exploration of ideas, increasing the surface for thought.
Making linking explicit between notes also encourages one to think about the
connections between concepts.

At the corner of each note, Luhmann ascribed each note with an ordered ID,
allowing him to link and jump between notes. In Org-roam, we simply use
hyperlinks.

Org-roam is the slip-box, digitalized in Org-mode. Every zettel (card) is a
plain-text, Org-mode file. In the same way one would maintain a paper slip-box,
Org-roam makes it easy to create new zettels, pre-filling boilerplate content
using a powerful templating system.

** Fleeting notes

A slip-box requires a method for quickly capturing ideas. These are called
*fleeting notes*: they are simple reminders of information or ideas that will
need to be processed later on, or trashed. This is typically accomplished using
~org-capture~ (see info:org#capture), or using Org-roam's daily notes
functionality (see [[*Daily-notes][Daily-notes]]). This provides a central inbox for collecting
thoughts, to be processed later into permanent notes.

** Permanent notes

Permanent notes are further split into two categories: *literature notes* and
*concept notes*. Literature notes can be brief annotations on a particular
source (e.g. book, website or paper), that you'd like to access later on.
Concept notes require much more care in authoring: they need to be
self-explanatory and detailed. Org-roam's templating system supports the
addition of different templates to facilitate the creation of these notes.

* Installation

Org-roam can be installed using Emacs' package manager or manually from its
development repository.

** Installing from MELPA

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven't used Emacs'
package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by reading the
documentation in the Emacs manual, see info:emacs#Packages. Then, add one of the
archives to =package-archives=:

- To use Melpa:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

- To use Melpa-Stable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Org-roam also depends on a recent version of Org, which can be obtained in Org's
package repository (see info:org#Installation). To use Org's ELPA archive:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
#+END_SRC

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-refresh-contents RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its dependencies
using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now see [[*Post-Installation Tasks][Post-Installation Tasks]].

** Installing from Apt

Users of Debian 11 or later or Ubuntu 20.10 or later can simply install Org-roam
using Apt:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  apt-get install elpa-org-roam
#+END_SRC

Org-roam will then be autoloaded into Emacs.

** Installing from the Git Repository

You may install Org-roam directly from the repository on [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][GitHub]] if you like.
This will give you access to the latest version hours or days before it appears
on MELPA, and months (or more) before it is added to the Debian or Ubuntu
repositories. This will also give you access to various developmental branches
that may be available.

Note, however, that development version, and especially any feature branches,
may not always be in working order. You'll need to be prepared to do some
debugging, or to manually roll-back to working versions, if you install from
GitHub.

Installing from GitHub requires that you clone the repository:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam.git /path/to/org/roam
#+end_src

where ~./path/to/org/roam~ is the location you will store your copy of the code.

Next, you need to add this location to your load path, and ~require~ the
Org-roam library. Add the following code to your ~.emacs~:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org/roam")
(require 'org-roam)
#+end_src

You now have Org-roam installed. However, you don't necessarily have the
dependencies that it requires. These include:

- dash
- f
- s
- org
- emacsql
- emacsql-sqlite3

You can install this manually as well, or get the latest version from MELPA. You
may wish to use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] to help manage this.

If you would like to install the manual for access from Emacs' built-in Info
system, you'll need to compile the .texi source file, and install it in an
appropriate location.

To compile the .texi source file, from a terminal navigate to the ~/doc~
subdirectory of the Org-roam repository, and run the following:

#+begin_src bash
make infodir=/path/to/my/info/files install-info
#+end_src

Where ~/path/to/my/info/files~ is the location where you keep info files. This
target directory needs to be stored in the variable
`Info-default-directory-list`. If you aren't using one of the default info
locations, you can configure this with the following in your ~.emacs~ file:

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'info)
  (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list
               "/path/to/my/info/files")
#+end_src

You can also use one of the default locations, such as:

- /usr/local/share/info/
- /usr/share/info/
- /usr/local/share/info/

If you do this, you'll need to make sure you have write-access to that location,
or run the above ~make~ command as root.

Now that the info file is ready, you need to add it to the corresponding ~dir~
file:

#+begin_src bash
install-info /path/to/my/info/files/org-roam.info /path/to/my/info/files/dir
#+end_src

** Post-Installation Tasks

Org-roam uses ~emacsql-sqlite3~, which requires ~sqlite3~ to be located on
~exec-path~. Please ensure that ~sqlite3~ is installed appropriately on your
operating system. You can verify that this is the case by executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (executable-find "sqlite3")
#+END_SRC

If you have ~sqlite3~ installed, and ~executable-find~ still reports ~nil~, then
it is likely that the path to the executable is not a member of the Emacs
variable ~exec-path~. You may rectify this by manually adding the path within
your Emacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "path/to/sqlite3")
#+END_SRC

* Getting Started

This short tutorial describes the essential commands used in Org-roam, to help
you get started.

First, it is important to understand how Org-roam was designed. Org-roam was
built to support a workflow that was not possible with vanilla Org-mode. This
flow is modelled after the [[https://zettelkasten.de/][Zettelkasten Method]], and many of [[https://roamresearch.com][Roam Research's]]
workflows. Org-roam does not magically make note-taking better -- this often
requires a radical change in your current note-taking workflow. To understand
more about the methods and madness, see [[*Note-taking Workflows][Note-taking Workflows]].

To first start using Org-roam, one needs to pick a location to store the
Org-roam files. The directory that will contain your notes is specified by the
variable ~org-roam-directory~. This variable needs to be set before any calls to
Org-roam functions, including enabling ~org-roam-mode~. For this tutorial,
create an empty directory, and set ~org-roam-directory~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(make-directory "~/org-roam")
(setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")
#+END_SRC

We encourage using a flat hierarchy for storing notes, but some prefer using
folders for storing specific kinds of notes (e.g. websites, papers). This is
fine; Org-roam searches recursively within ~org-roam-directory~ for notes.
Instead of relying on the file hierarchy for any form of categorization, one
should use links between files to establish connections between notes.

Next, we need to enable the global minor mode ~org-roam-mode~. This sets up
Emacs with several hooks, building a cache that is kept consistent as your
slip-box grows. We recommend starting ~org-roam-mode~ on startup:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)
#+END_SRC

To build the cache manually, one can run ~M-x org-roam-db-build-cache~. Cache
builds may take a while the first time, but is often instantaneous in subsequent
runs because it only reprocesses modified files.

Let us now create our first note. Call ~M-x org-roam-find-file~. This shows a
list of titles for notes that reside in ~org-roam-directory~. It should show
nothing right now, since there are no notes in the directory. Entering the title
of the note you wish to create, and pressing ~RET~ should begin the note
creation process. This process uses ~org-capture~'s templating system, and can
be customized (see [[*The Templating System][The Templating System]]). Using the default template, pressing
~C-c C-c~ finishes the note capture. Running ~M-x org-roam-find-file~ again
should show the note you have created, and selecting that entry will bring you
to that note.

Org-roam makes it easy to create notes, and link them together. To link notes
together, we call ~M-x org-roam-insert~. This brings up a prompt with a list of
title for existing notes. Selecting an existing entry will create and insert a
link to the current file. Entering a non-existent title will create a new note
with that title. Good usage of Org-roam requires liberally linking files: this
facilitates building up a dense graph of inter-connected notes.

Org-roam provides an interface to view backlinks. It shows backlinks for the
currently active Org-roam note, along with some surrounding context. To toggle
the visibility of this buffer, call ~M-x org-roam~.

For a visual representation of the notes and their connections, Org-roam also
provides graphing capabilities, using Graphviz. It generates graphs with notes
as nodes, and links between them as edges. The generated graph can be used to
navigate to the files, but this requires some additional setup (see [[*Roam
Protocol][Roam Protocol]]).

* Files
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3edec3e6-8e26-4a43-8a0a-bf204268bbb3
:END:

In Org-roam, notes typically consist of multiple files, where each file is a
zettel.

While the bulk of Org-roam's functionality is built on top of vanilla Org-mode,
Org-roam adds several Org-roam-specific keywords to support additional
functionality.

This section explains the important components of a file, and the extensions to
Org-mode.

** File Titles

To easily find a note, a title needs to be prescribed to a note.

A note can have many titles: this allows a note to be referred to by different
names, which is especially useful for topics or concepts with acronyms. For
example, for a note like "World War 2", it may be desirable to also refer to it
using the acronym "WWII".

Org-roam calls ~org-roam--extract-titles~ to extract titles. It uses the
variable ~org-roam-title-sources~, to control how the titles are extracted. The
title extraction methods supported are:

1. ~'title~: This extracts the title using the file ~#+title~ property
2. ~'headline~: This extracts the title from the first headline in the Org file
3. ~'alias~: This extracts a list of titles using the ~#+roam_alias~ property.
   The aliases are space-delimited, and can be multi-worded using quotes.

Take for example the following org file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+title: World War 2
  #+roam_alias: "WWII" "World War II"

  * Headline
#+END_SRC

| Method      | Titles                   |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| ~'title~    | '("World War 2")         |
| ~'headline~ | '("Headline")            |
| ~'alias~    | '("WWII" "World War II") |

If no title is provided, Org-roam defaults to using the file-path.

*** Customizing Title Extraction

To control how Org-roam extracts titles, customize ~org-roam-title-sources~. If
all methods of title extraction return no results, the file-name is used as the
note's title.

- User Option: org-roam-title-sources

  The list of sources from which to retrieve a note title.
  Each element in the list is either:

1. a symbol -- this symbol corresponds to a title retrieval function, which
   returns the list of titles for the current buffer
  2. a list of symbols -- symbols in the list are treated as with (1). The
     return value of this list is the first symbol in the list returning a
     non-nil value.

  The return results of the root list are concatenated.

  For example the setting: '((title headline) alias) means the following:

  1. Return the 'title + 'alias, if the title of current buffer is non-empty;
  2. Or return 'headline + 'alias otherwise.

  The currently supported symbols are:

   ~'title~
   The ~#+title~ property of org file.

   ~'alias~
   The ~#+roam_alias~ property of the org file, using
   space-delimited strings.

   ~'headline~
   The first headline in the org file.

Adding your own title extraction method requires two steps. First, define a
method ~(defun org-roam--extract-titles-foo () ...)~, where ~foo~ a
self-prescribed name for the title extraction method. This method takes no
arguments, and returns a list of strings (titles). Finally, push the symbol
~foo~ into ~org-roam-title-sources~. You may need to rebuild the cache from
scratch to re-process all files to pick up the new titles.

** File Tags

Tags are used as meta-data for files: they facilitate interactions with notes
where titles are insufficient. For example, tags allow for categorization of
notes: differentiating between bibliographical and structure notes during
interactive commands.

By default, tags are extracted from the ~#+roam_tags~ property. To add
additional extraction methods, see [[id:c986edba-9498-4af1-b033-c94b733d42c8][Customizing Tag Extraction]].

*** Customizing Tag Extraction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c986edba-9498-4af1-b033-c94b733d42c8
:END:

Org-roam calls ~org-roam--extract-tags~ to extract tags from files. The variable
~org-roam-tag-sources~, to control how tags are extracted.

- User Option: org-roam-tag-sources

Sources to obtain tags from.

It should be a list of symbols representing any of the following extraction
methods:

  ~'prop~
    Extract tags from the ~#+roam_tags~ property.
    Tags are space delimited.
    Tags may contain spaces if they are double-quoted.
    e.g. ~#+roam_tags: TAG "tag with spaces"~

  ~'vanilla~
    Extract vanilla org-mode tags, including ~#+FILETAGS~ and
    inherited tags.

  ~'all-directories~
    Extract sub-directories relative to ~org-roam-directory~.
    That is, if a file is located at relative path foo/bar/file.org,
    the file will have tags "foo" and "bar".

  ~'last-directory~
    Extract the last directory relative to `org-roam-directory'.
    That is, if a file is located at relative path foo/bar/file.org,
    the file will have tag \"bar\".

  ~'first-directory~
    Extract the first directory relative to ~org-roam-directory~.
    That is, if a file is located at relative path foo/bar/file.org,
    the file will have tag "foo"
    
By default, only the ~'prop~ extraction method is enabled. To enable the other
extraction methods, you may modify ~org-roam-tag-sources~, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-tag-sources '(prop last-directory))
#+END_SRC

Adding your own tag extraction method requires two steps. First, define a method
~(defun org-roam--extract-tags-foo (file) ...)~, where ~foo~ a self-prescribed
name for the tag extraction method. This method takes the file path as an
argument, and returns a list of strings (titles). Finally, push the symbol ~foo~
into ~org-roam-tag-sources~. You may need to rebuild the cache from scratch to
re-process all files to pick up the new tags.

** File Refs

Refs are unique identifiers for files. For example, a note for a website may
contain a ref:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+title: Google
  #+roam_key: https://www.google.com/
#+END_SRC

These keys allow references to the key to show up in the backlinks buffer. For
instance, with the example above, if another file then links to
https://www.google.com, that will show up as a “Ref Backlink”.

These keys also come in useful for when taking website notes, using the
 ~roam-ref~ protocol (see [[*Roam Protocol][Roam Protocol]]).

[[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] citation keys can also be used as refs:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+title: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
  #+roam_key: cite:chen18_neural_ordin_differ_equat
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: org-ref-citelink
[[file:images/org-ref-citelink.png]]

You may assign multiple refs to a single file, for example when you want
multiple papers in a series to share the same note, or an article has a citation
key and a URL at the same time.

* The Templating System

Rather than creating blank files on ~org-roam-insert~ and ~org-roam-find-file~,
it may be desirable to prefill the file with templated content. This may
include:

- Time of creation
- File it was created from
- Clipboard content
- Any other data you may want to input manually

This requires a complex template insertion system. Fortunately, Org ships with a
powerful one: ~org-capture~ (see info:org#capture). However, org-capture was not
designed for such use. Org-roam abuses ~org-capture~, extending its syntax and
capabilities. To first understand how org-roam's templating system works, it may
be useful to look into basic usage of ~org-capture~.

For these reasons, Org-roam capture templates are not compatible with regular
~org-capture~. Hence, Org-roam's templates can be customized by instead
modifying the variable ~org-roam-capture-templates~. Just like
~org-capture-templates~, ~org-roam-capture-templates~ can contain multiple
templates. If ~org-roam-capture-templates~ only contains one template, there
will be no prompt for template selection.

** Template Walkthrough

To demonstrate the additions made to org-capture templates. Here, we walkthrough
the default template, reproduced below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
       "%?"
       :file-name "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}"
       :head "#+title: ${title}\n"
       :unnarrowed t)
#+END_SRC

1. The template has short key ~"d"~. If you have only one template, org-roam
   automatically chooses this template for you.
2. The template is given a description of ~"default"~.
3. ~plain~ text is inserted. Other options include Org headings via
   ~entry~.
4. ~(function org-roam--capture-get-point)~ should not be changed.
5. ~"%?"~ is the template inserted on each call to ~org-roam-capture--capture~.
   This template means don't insert any content, but place the cursor here.
6. ~:file-name~ is the file-name template for a new note, if it doesn't yet
   exist. This creates a file at path that looks like
   ~/path/to/org-roam-directory/20200213032037-foo.org~. This template also
   allows you to specify if you want the note to go into a subdirectory. For
   example, the template ~private/${slug}~ will create notes in
   ~/path/to/org-roam-directory/private~.
7. ~:head~ contains the initial template to be inserted (once only), at
   the beginning of the file. Here, the title global attribute is
   inserted.
8. ~:unnarrowed t~ tells org-capture to show the contents for the whole
   file, rather than narrowing to just the entry.

Other options you may want to learn about include ~:immediate-finish~.

** Org-roam Template Expansion

Org-roam's template definitions also extend org-capture's template syntax, to
allow prefilling of strings. We have seen a glimpse of this in [[*Template Walkthrough][Template
Walkthrough]].

In org-roam templates, the ~${var}~ syntax allows for the expansion of
variables, stored in ~org-roam-capture--info~. For example, during
~org-roam-insert~, the user is prompted for a title. Upon entering a
non-existent title, the ~title~ key in ~org-roam-capture--info~ is set to the
provided title. ~${title}~ is then expanded into the provided title during the
org-capture process. Any variables that do not contain strings, are prompted for
values using ~completing-read~.

After doing this expansion, the org-capture's template expansion system is used
to fill up the rest of the template. You may read up more on this on
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion][org-capture's documentation page]].

To illustrate this dual expansion process, take for example the template string:
~"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${title}"~, with the title ~"Foo"~. The template is first
expanded into ~%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-Foo~. Then org-capture expands ~%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>~
with timestamp: e.g. ~20200213032037-Foo~.

All of the flexibility afforded by Emacs and Org-mode are available. For
example, if you want to encode a UTC timestamp in the filename, you can take
advantage of org-mode's ~%(EXP)~ template expansion to call ~format-time-string~
directly to provide its third argument to specify UTC.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
       "%?"
       :file-name "%(format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%SZ--${slug}\" (current-time) t)"
       :head "#+title: ${title}\n"
       :unnarrowed t)

* Concepts and Configuration
The number of configuration options is deliberately kept small, to keep the
Org-roam codebase manageable. However, we attempt to accommodate as many usage
styles as possible.

All of Org-roam's customization options can be viewed via ~M-x customize-group
org-roam~.

** Directories and Files

This section concerns the placement and creation of files.

- Variable: org-roam-directory

  This is the default path to Org-roam files. All Org files, at any level of
  nesting, are considered part of the Org-roam.

- Variable: org-roam-db-location

  Location of the Org-roam database. If this is non-nil, the Org-roam sqlite
  database is saved here.

  It is the user’s responsibility to set this correctly, especially when used
  with multiple Org-roam instances.

- Variable: org-roam-file-exclude-regexp

  Files matching this regular expression are excluded from the Org-roam.

** The Org-roam Buffer

The Org-roam buffer displays backlinks for the currently active Org-roam note.

- User Option: org-roam-buffer

  The name of the org-roam buffer. Defaults to ~*org-roam*~.

- User Option: org-roam-buffer-position

  The position of the Org-roam buffer side window. Valid values are ~'left~,
  ~'right~, ~'top~, ~'bottom~.

- User Option: org-roam-buffer-width

  Width of ~org-roam-buffer~. Has an effect only if ~org-roam-buffer-position~ is
  ~'left~ or ~'right~.

- User Option: org-roam-buffer-height

  Height of ~org-roam-buffer~. Has an effect only if ~org-roam-buffer-position~ is
  ~'top~ or ~'bottom~.

- User Option: org-roam-buffer-window-parameters

  Additional window parameters for the org-roam-buffer side window.

  For example one can prevent the window from being deleted when calling
  ~delete-other-windows~, by setting it with the following:

  ~(setq org-roam-buffer-window-parameters '((no-delete-other-windows . t)))~
  
** Org-roam Files

Org-roam files are created and prefilled using Org-roam's templating
system. The templating system is customizable (see [[*The Templating System][The Templating System]]).

** Org-roam Faces

Org-roam introduces several faces to distinguish links within the same buffer.
These faces are enabled by default in Org-roam notes.

- User Option: org-roam-link-use-custom-faces

  When ~t~, use custom faces only inside Org-roam notes.
  When ~everywhere~, the custom face is applied additionally to non Org-roam notes.
  When ~nil~, do not use Org-roam's custom faces.

The ~org-roam-link~ face is the face applied to links to other Org-roam files.
This distinguishes internal links from external links (e.g. external web links).

The ~org-roam-link-current~ face corresponds to links to the same file it is in.

The ~org-roam-link-invalid~ face is applied to links that are broken. These are
links to files or IDs that cannot be found.
** TODO The Database

Org-roam is backed by a Sqlite database.

- User Option: org-roam-db-update-method

  Method to update the Org-roam database.

  ~'immediate~: Update the database immediately upon file changes.

  ~'idle-timer~: Updates the database if dirty, if Emacs idles for
  ~org-roam-db-update-idle-seconds~.

- User Option: org-roam-db-update-idle-seconds

  Number of idle seconds before triggering an Org-roam database update. This is
  only valid if ~org-roam-db-update-method~ is ~'idle-timer~.

* Inserting Links

The preferred mode of linking is via ~file~ links to files, and ~id~ links for
headlines. This maintains the strongest compatibility with Org-mode, ensuring
that the links still function without Org-roam, and work well exporting to other
backends.

~file~ links can be inserted via ~org-roam-insert~. Links to headlines can be
inserted by navigating to the desired headline and calling ~org-store-link~.
This will create an ID for the headline if it does not already exist, and
populate the Org-roam database. The link can then be inserted via
~org-insert-link~.

An alternative mode of insertion is using Org-roam's ~roam~ links. Org-roam
registers this link type, and interprets the path as follows:

- ~[[roam:title]]~ :: links to an Org-roam file with title or alias "title"
- ~[[roam:*headline]]~ :: links to the headline "headline" in the current
  Org-roam file
- ~[[roam:title*headline]]~ :: links to the headline "headline" in the Org-roam
  file with title or alias "title"

- User Option: org-roam-link-title-format

  To distinguish between org-roam links and regular links, one may choose to use
  special indicators for Org-roam links. Defaults to ~"%s"~.

  If your version of Org is at least ~9.2~, consider styling the link differently,
  by customizing the ~org-roam-link~, and ~org-roam-link-current~ faces.

- User Option: org-roam-link-auto-replace

  When non-nil, ~roam~ links will be replaced with ~file~ or ~id~ links when
  they are navigated to, and on file save, when a match is found. This is
  desirable to maintain compatibility with vanilla Org, but resolved links are
  harder to edit. Defaults to ~t~.

* Completions

Completions for Org-roam are provided via ~completion-at-point~. Completion
suggestions are implemented as separate functions. Org-roam installs all
functions in ~org-roam-completion-functions~ to ~completion-at-point-functions~.

- Variable: org-roam-completion-functions

  The list of functions to be used with ~completion-at-point~.

- User Option: org-roam-completion-ignore-case

  When non-nil, the ~roam~ link completions are ignore case. For example,
  calling ~completion-at-point~ within ~[[roam:fo]]~ will present a completion
  for a file with title "Foo". Defaults to ~t~.

To use the completions from Org-roam with ~company-mode~, prepend ~company-capf~
to variable ~company-backends~.

** Link Completion

~roam~ links support auto-completion via ~completion-at-point~: simply call
~M-x completion-at-point~ within a roam link. That is, where the ~|~ character
represents the cursor:

- ~[[|]]~: completes for a file title
- ~[[roam:]]~: completes for a file title
- ~[[*|]]~: completes for a headline within this file
- ~[[foo*|]]~: completes a headline within the file with title "foo"
- ~[[roam:foo*|]]~ completes a headline within the file with title "foo"

Completions account for the current input. For example, for ~[[f|]]~, the
completions (by default) only show for files with titles that start with "f".

- Function: org-roam-link-complete-at-point

  Do appropriate completion for the link at point.

*** Link Completions Everywhere

Org-roam is able to provide completions from the current word at point, enabling
as-you-type link completions. However, this is disabled by default: the author
believes that linking should be a deliberate action and linking should be
performed with great care.

Setting ~org-roam-completion-everywhere~ to ~t~ will enable word-at-point
completions.

- User Option: org-roam-completion-everywhere

  If non-nil, provide completions from the current word at point. That is, in
  the scenario ~this is a sent|~, calling ~completion-at-point~ will show
  completions for titles that begin with "sent".

** Tag Completion

Org-roam facilitates the insertion of existing tags via ~completion-at-point~.

That is, suppose you have notes with tags "foo", and "bar". Now, in a note, if
you're on a line beginning with ~#+roam_tags:~, completions for these will
appear as-you-type if they match.

This functionality is implemented in ~org-roam-complete-tags-at-point~.

* Navigating Around
** Index File

As your collection grows, you might want to create an index where you keep links
to your main files.

In Org-roam, you can define the path to your index file by setting
~org-roam-index-file~.

- Variable: org-roam-index-file

  Path to the Org-roam index file.

  The path can be a string or a function. If it is a string, it should be the
  path (absolute or relative to ~org-roam-directory~) to the index file. If it
  is is a function, the function should return the path to the index file.
  Otherwise, the index is assumed to be a note in ~org-roam-index~ whose
  title is ~"Index"~.

- Function: org-roam-find-index

  Opens the Index file in the current ~org-roam-directory~.

* Encryption

One may wish to keep private, encrypted files. Org-roam supports encryption (via
GPG), which can be enabled for all new files by setting ~org-roam-encrypt-files~
to ~t~. When enabled, new files are created with the ~.org.gpg~ extension and
decryption are handled automatically by EasyPG.

Note that Emacs will prompt for a password for encrypted files during cache
updates if it requires reading the encrypted file. To reduce the number of
password prompts, you may wish to cache the password.

- User Option: org-roam-encrypt-files

  Whether to encrypt new files. If true, create files with .org.gpg extension.

* Graphing

Org-roam provides graphing capabilities to explore interconnections between
notes. This is done by performing SQL queries and generating images using
[[https://graphviz.org/][Graphviz]]. The graph can also be navigated: see [[*Roam Protocol][Roam Protocol]].

The entry point to graph creation is ~org-roam-graph~.

- Function: org-roam-graph & optional arg file node-query

  Build and possibly display a graph for FILE from NODE-QUERY.
  If FILE is nil, default to current buffer’s file name.
  ARG may be any of the following values:

  - ~nil~       show the graph.
  - ~C-u~       show the graph for FILE.
  - ~C-u N~     show the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.
  - ~C-u C-u~   build the graph.
  - ~C-u -~     build the graph for FILE.
  - ~C-u -N~    build the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.

- User Option: org-roam-graph-executable

  Path to the graphing executable (in this case, Graphviz). Set this if Org-roam
  is unable to find the Graphviz executable on your system.

  You may also choose to use ~neato~ in place of ~dot~, which generates a more
  compact graph layout.

- User Option: org-roam-graph-viewer

  Org-roam defaults to using Firefox (located on PATH) to view the SVG, but you
  may choose to set it to:

  1. A string, which is a path to the program used
  2. a function accepting a single argument: the graph file path.

  ~nil~ uses ~view-file~ to view the graph.
  
  If you are using WSL2 and would like to open the graph in Windows, you can use
  the second option to set the browser and network file path:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-graph-viewer
      (lambda (file)
        (let ((org-roam-graph-viewer "/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe"))
          (org-roam-graph--open (concat "file://///wsl$/Ubuntu" file)))))
  #+END_SRC

** Graph Options

Graphviz provides many options for customizing the graph output, and Org-roam
supports some of them. See https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/attrs.html
for customizable options.

- User Option: org-roam-graph-extra-config

  Extra options passed to graphviz for the digraph (The "G" attributes).
  Example: ~'~(("rankdir" . "LR"))~

- User Option: org-roam-graph-node-extra-config

  Extra options for nodes in the graphviz output (The "N" attributes).
  Example: ~'(("color" . "skyblue"))~

- User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-extra-config

  Extra options for edges in the graphviz output (The "E" attributes).
  Example: ~'(("dir" . "back"))~

- User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-cites-extra-config

  Extra options for citation edges in the graphviz output.
  Example: ~'(("color" . "red"))~

** Excluding Nodes and Edges

One may want to exclude certain files to declutter the graph.

- User Option: org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher

  Matcher for excluding nodes from the generated graph. Any nodes and links for
  file paths matching this string is excluded from the graph.

  If value is a string, the string is the only matcher.

  If value is a list, all file paths matching any of the strings
  are excluded.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher '("private" "dailies"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This setting excludes all files whose path contain "private" or "dailies".

* Minibuffer Completion

Org-roam allows customization of which minibuffer completion system to use for
its interactive commands. The default setting uses Emacs' standard
~completing-read~ mechanism.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-completion-system 'default)
#+END_SRC

If you have installed Helm or Ivy, and have their modes enabled, under the
~'default~ setting they will be used.

In the rare scenario where you use Ivy globally, but prefer [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]] for org-roam
commands, set:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-completion-system 'helm)
#+END_SRC

Other options include ~'ido~, and ~'ivy~.

* Roam Protocol

Org-roam extends ~org-protocol~ with 2 protocols: the ~roam-file~ and ~roam-ref~
protocols.

** Installation

To enable Org-roam's protocol extensions, you have to add the following to your
init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-roam-protocol)
#+END_SRC

The instructions for setting up ~org-protocol~ are reproduced below.

We will also need to create a desktop application for ~emacsclient~. The
instructions for various platforms are shown below.

For Linux users, create a desktop application in
~~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop~:

#+begin_example
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Org-Protocol
Exec=emacsclient %u
Icon=emacs-icon
Type=Application
Terminal=false
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
#+end_example

Associate ~org-protocol://~ links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
#+END_SRC

To disable the "confirm" prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome show a
checkbox to tick, so that the ~Org-Protocol Client~ app will be used without
confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
{
  "ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox": true
}
EOF
sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json
#+END_SRC

and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to <chrome://restart>) to
make the new policy take effect.

See [[https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start][here]] for more info on the ~/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed~ directory and
[[https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox][here]] for information on the ~ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox~ policy.

For MacOS, one solution is to use [[https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus][Platypus]]. Here are the instructions for
setting up with Platypus and Chrome:

1. Install and launch Platypus (with [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew cask install platypus
#+END_SRC

2. Create a script ~launch_emacs.sh~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
/usr/local/bin/emacsclient --no-wait $1
#+END_SRC

3. Create a Platypus app with the following settings:

| Setting                        | Value                     |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------|
| App Name                       | "OrgProtocol"             |
| Script Type                    | "env" · "/usr/bin/env"    |
| Script Path                    | "path/to/launch-emacs.sh" |
| Interface                      | None                      |
| Accept dropped items           | true                      |
| Remain running after execution | false                     |


Inside ~Settings~:

| Setting                        | Value          |
|--------------------------------+----------------|
| Accept dropped files           | true           |
| Register as URI scheme handler | true           |
| Protocol                       | "org-protocol" |

To disable the "confirm" prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ~OrgProtocol~ app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true
#+END_SRC


If you're using [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][Emacs Mac Port]], it registered its `Emacs.app` as the default
handler for the URL scheme `org-protocol`. To make ~OrgProtocol.app~
the default handler instead, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
'{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = { "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";}'
#+END_SRC

Then restart your computer.

For Windows, create a temporary ~org-protocol.reg~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol]
@="URL:Org Protocol"
"URL Protocol"=""
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open\command]
@="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe\" emacsclient \"%1\""
#+END_SRC

The above will forward the protocol to WSL. If you run Emacs natively on
Windows, replace the last line with:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
@="\"c:\\path\\to\\emacs\\bin\\emacsclientw.exe\"  \"%1\""
#+END_SRC

After executing the .reg file, the protocol is registered and you can delete the
file.

** The roam-file protocol

This is a simple protocol that opens the path specified by the ~file~
key (e.g. ~org-protocol://roam-file?file=/tmp/file.org~). This is used
in the generated graph.

** The roam-ref protocol

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given ~roam_key~ (see [[id:3edec3e6-8e26-4a43-8a0a-bf204268bbb3][Files]]):

[[file:images/roam-ref.gif]]

To use this, create the following [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet][bookmarklet]] in your browser:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  javascript:location.href =
      'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
      + encodeURIComponent(location.href)
      + '&title='
      + encodeURIComponent(document.title)
      + '&body='
      + encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())
#+END_SRC

or as a keybinding in ~qutebrowser~ in , using the ~config.py~ file (see
[[https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc][Configuring qutebrowser]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  config.bind("<Ctrl-r>", "open javascript:location.href='org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)")
#+END_SRC

where ~template~ is the template key for a template in
~org-roam-capture-ref-templates~ (see [[*The Templating System][The Templating System]]). These templates
should contain a ~#+roam_key: ${ref}~ in it.

* Daily-notes

Org-roam provides journaling capabilities akin to
[[#org-journal][Org-journal]] with ~org-roam-dailies~.

** Configuration

For ~org-roam-dailies~ to work, you need to define two variables:

- Variable: ~org-roam-dailies-directory~

  Path to daily-notes.

- Variable: ~org-roam-dailies-capture-templates~

  Capture templates for daily-notes in Org-roam.

Here is a sane default configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "daily/")

  (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
        '(("d" "default" entry
           #'org-roam-capture--get-point
           "* %?"
           :file-name "daily/%<%Y-%m-%d>"
           :head "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n\n")))
#+end_src

Make sure that ~org-roam-dailies-directory~ appears in ~:file-name~ for your
notes to be recognized as daily-notes. You can have different templates placing
their notes in different directories, but the one in
~org-roam-dailies-directory~ will be considered as the main one in commands.

See [[*The Templating System][The Templating System]] for creating new
templates. ~org-roam-dailies~ provides an extra ~:olp~ option which allows
specifying the outline-path to a heading:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
        '(("l" "lab" entry
           #'org-roam-capture--get-point
           "* %?"
           :file-name "daily/%<%Y-%m-%d>"
           :head "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"
           :olp ("Lab notes"))

          ("j" "journal" entry
           #'org-roam-capture--get-point
           "* %?"
           :file-name "daily/%<%Y-%m-%d>"
           :head "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"
           :olp ("Journal"))))
#+end_src

The template ~l~ will put its notes under the heading ‘Lab notes’, and the
template ~j~ will put its notes under the heading ‘Journal’. 

** Capturing and finding daily-notes

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-capture-today~ &optional goto

  Create an entry in the daily note for today.

  When ~goto~ is non-nil, go the note without creating an entry.

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-find-today~

  Find the daily note for today, creating it if necessary.

There are variants of those commands for ~-yesterday~ and ~-tomorrow~:

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday~ n &optional goto

  Create an entry in the daily note for yesteday.

  With numeric argument ~n~, use the daily note ~n~ days in the past.

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-find-yesterday~

  With numeric argument N, use the daily-note N days in the future.

There are also commands which allow you to use Emacs’s ~calendar~ to find the date

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-capture-date~

  Create an entry in the daily note for a date using the calendar.

  Prefer past dates, unless ~prefer-future~ is non-nil.
  
  With a 'C-u' prefix or when ~goto~ is non-nil, go the note without
  creating an entry.

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-find-date~

  Find the daily note for a date using the calendar, creating it if necessary.

  Prefer past dates, unless ~prefer-future~ is non-nil.

** Navigation
  
You can navigate between daily-notes:

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-find-directory~

  Find and open ~org-roam-dailies-directory~.

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-find-previous-note~

  When in an daily-note, find the previous one.

- Function: ~org-roam-dailies-find-next-note~

  When in an daily-note, find the next one.

* Diagnosing and Repairing Files

Org-roam provides a utility for diagnosing and repairing problematic files via
~org-roam-doctor~. By default, ~org-roam-doctor~ runs the check on the current
Org-roam file. To run the check only for the current file, run ~C-u M-x
org-roam-doctor~, but note that this may take some time.

- Function: org-roam-doctor &optional this-buffer

  Perform a check on Org-roam files to ensure cleanliness. If THIS-BUFFER, run
  the check only for the current buffer.

The checks run are defined in ~org-roam-doctor--checkers~. By default, there are
checkers for broken links and invalid =#+roam_*= properties.

Each checker is an instance of ~org-roam-doctor-checker~. To define a checker,
use ~make-org-roam-doctor-checker~. Here is a sample definition:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(make-org-roam-doctor-checker
    :name 'org-roam-doctor-broken-links
    :description "Fix broken links."
    :actions '(("d" . ("Unlink" . org-roam-doctor--remove-link))
               ("r" . ("Replace link" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link))
               ("R" . ("Replace link (keep label)" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link-keep-label))))
#+END_SRC

The ~:name~ property is the name of the function run. The function takes in the
Org parse tree, and returns a list of ~(point error-message)~. ~:description~ is
a short description of what the checker does. ~:actions~ is an alist containing
elements of the form ~(char . (prompt . function))~. These actions are defined
per checker, to perform autofixes for the errors. For each error detected,
~org-roam-doctor~ will move the point to the current error, and pop-up a help
window displaying the error message, as well as the list of actions that can be
taken provided in ~:actions~.

* Finding Unlinked References

Unlinked references are occurrences of strings of text that exactly match the
title or alias of an existing note in the Org-roam database. Org-roam provides
facilities for discovering these unlinked references, so one may decide whether
to convert them into links.

To use this feature, simply call ~M-x org-roam-unlinked-references~ from within
an Org-roam note. Internally, Org-roam uses [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] and a clever PCRE regex to
find occurrences of the title or aliases of the currently open note in all
Org-roam files. Hence, this requires a version of ripgrep that is compiled with
PCRE support.

#+begin_quote
NOTE: Since ripgrep cannot read encrypted files, this function cannot find
unlinked references within encrypted files.
#+end_quote

* Performance Optimization
** TODO Profiling Key Operations
** Garbage Collection

During the cache-build process, Org-roam generates a lot of in-memory
data-structures (such as the Org file's AST), which are discarded after use.
These structures are garbage collected at regular intervals (see [[info:elisp#Garbage
 Collection][info:elisp#Garbage Collection]]).

Org-roam provides the option ~org-roam-db-gc-threshold~ to temporarily change
the threshold value for GC to be triggered during these memory-intensive
operations. To reduce the number of garbage collection processes, one may set
~org-roam-db-gc-threshold~ to a high value (such as ~most-positive-fixnum~):

** Ecosystem

*** Browsing History with winner-mode

~winner-mode~ is a global minor mode that allows one to undo and redo changes in
the window configuration. It is included with GNU Emacs since version 20.

~winner-mode~ can be used as a simple version of browser history for Org-roam.
Each click through org-roam links (from both Org files and the backlinks buffer)
causes changes in window configuration, which can be undone and redone using
~winner-mode~. To use ~winner-mode~, simply enable it, and bind the appropriate
interactive functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (winner-mode +1)
  (define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-left>") #'winner-undo)
  (define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-right>") #'winner-redo)

#+END_SRC
*** Versioning Notes

Since Org-roam notes are just plain text, it is trivial to track changes in your
notes database using version control systems such as [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]]. Simply initialize
~org-roam-directory~ as a Git repository, and commit your files at regular or
appropriate intervals. [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is a great interface to Git within Emacs.

In addition, it may be useful to observe how a particular note has evolved, by
looking at the file history. [[https://gitlab.com/pidu/git-timemachine][Git-timemachine]] allows you to visit historic
versions of a tracked Org-roam note.

*** Full-text search interface with Deft
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: deft
   :END:

[[https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/][Deft]] provides a nice interface for browsing and filtering org-roam notes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package deft
    :after org
    :bind
    ("C-c n d" . deft)
    :custom
    (deft-recursive t)
    (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
    (deft-default-extension "org")
    (deft-directory "/path/to/org-roam-files/"))
#+END_SRC

If the title of the Org file is not the first line, you might not get nice
titles. You may choose to patch this to use ~org-roam~'s functionality. Here I'm
using [[https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch][el-patch]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package el-patch
    :straight (:host github
               :repo "raxod502/el-patch"
               :branch "develop"))

  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'el-patch))

  (use-package deft
    ;; same as above...
    :config/el-patch
    (defun deft-parse-title (file contents)
      "Parse the given FILE and CONTENTS and determine the title.
  If `deft-use-filename-as-title' is nil, the title is taken to
  be the first non-empty line of the FILE.  Else the base name of the FILE is
  used as title."
      (el-patch-swap (if deft-use-filename-as-title
                         (deft-base-filename file)
                       (let ((begin (string-match "^.+$" contents)))
                         (if begin
                             (funcall deft-parse-title-function
                                      (substring contents begin (match-end 0))))))
                     (org-roam-db--get-title file))))
#+END_SRC

The Deft interface can slow down quickly when the number of files get huge.
[[https://github.com/hasu/notdeft][Notdeft]] is a fork of Deft that uses an external search engine and indexer.

*** Org-journal
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-journal
   :END:

[[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][Org-journal]] provides journaling capabilities to Org-mode. A lot of its
functionalities have been incorporated into Org-roam under the name
[[*Daily-notes][~org-roam-dailies~]]. It remains a good tool if you want to isolate your verbose
journal entries from the ideas you would write on a scratchpad.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-journal
    :bind
    ("C-c n j" . org-journal-new-entry)
    :custom
    (org-journal-date-prefix "#+title: ")
    (org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org")
    (org-journal-dir "/path/to/journal/files/")
    (org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y"))
#+END_SRC

*** Note-taking Add-ons
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: note-taking-add-ons
   :END:

These are some plugins that make note-taking in Org-mode more enjoyable.

**** Org-download
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: org-download
    :END:

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download][Org-download]] lets you screenshot and yank images from the web into your notes:

#+CAPTION: org-download
[[file:images/org-download.gif]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-download
    :after org
    :bind
    (:map org-mode-map
          (("s-Y" . org-download-screenshot)
           ("s-y" . org-download-yank))))
#+END_SRC

**** mathpix.el
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: mathpix.el
    :END:

[[https://github.com/jethrokuan/mathpix.el][mathpix.el]] uses [[https://mathpix.com/][Mathpix's]] API to convert clips into latex equations:

#+CAPTION: mathpix
[[file:images/mathpix.gif]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mathpix.el
    :straight (:host github :repo "jethrokuan/mathpix.el")
    :custom ((mathpix-app-id "app-id")
             (mathpix-app-key "app-key"))
    :bind
    ("C-x m" . mathpix-screenshot))
#+END_SRC

**** Org-noter / Interleave
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: org-noter-interleave
    :END:

[[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][Org-noter]] and
[[https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave][Interleave]] are both
projects that allow synchronised annotation of documents (PDF, EPUB
etc.) within Org-mode.

**** Bibliography
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bibliography
    :END:

[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex][org-roam-bibtex]] offers
tight integration between
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]],
[[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][helm-bibtex]] and
~org-roam~. This helps you manage your bibliographic notes under
~org-roam~.

For example, though helm-bibtex provides the ability to visit notes for
bibliographic entries, org-roam-bibtex extends it with the ability to visit the
file with the right =#+roam_key=.

**** Spaced Repetition
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spaced-repetition
    :END:

[[https://www.leonrische.me/fc/index.html][Org-fc]] is a spaced repetition system that scales well with a large number of
files. Other alternatives include [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html][org-drill]], and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam][pamparam]].

* FAQ
** How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?

Emacs supports directory-local variables, allowing the value of
~org-roam-directory~ to be different in different directories. It does this by
checking for a file named ~.dir-locals.el~.

To add support for multiple directories, override the ~org-roam-directory~
variable using directory-local variables. This is what ~.dir-locals.el~ may
contain:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ((nil . ((org-roam-directory . ".")
             (org-roam-db-location . "./org-roam.db"))))
#+END_SRC

All files within that directory will be treated as their own separate set of
Org-roam files. Remember to run ~org-roam-db-build-cache~ from a file within
that directory, at least once.

** How do I migrate from Roam Research?

Fabio has produced a command-line tool that converts markdown files exported
from Roam Research into Org-roam compatible markdown. More instructions are
provided [[https://github.com/fabioberger/roam-migration][in the repository]].

** How do I create a note whose title already matches one of the candidates?

This situation arises when, for example, one would like to create a note titled
"bar" when "barricade" already exists.

The solution is dependent on the mini-buffer completion framework in use. Here
are the solutions:

- Ivy :: call ~ivy-immediate-done~, typically bound to ~C-M-j~. Alternatively,
  set ~ivy-use-selectable-prompt~ to ~t~, so that "bar" is now selectable.
- Helm :: Org-roam should provide a selectable "[?] bar" candidate at the top of
  the candidate list.
