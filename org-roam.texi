@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Org-roam is a @uref{https://roamresearch.com/, Roam Research} replica built around the
all-powerful @uref{https://orgmode.org/, Org-mode}.

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy. Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution
for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

To understand more about Roam, a collection of links are available in
@ref{Note-taking Workflows}.

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

@table @asis
@item Privacy and Security
Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG@.
@item Longevity of Plain Text
Unlike web solutions like Roam research, the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files -- Org-roam simply builds up an auxilliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken down. Edit your plain-text notes in notepad if all other editors cease to exist
@item Free and Open Source
Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam, or open a PR@.
@item Leverages the Org-mode ecosystem
Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
@item Built on Emacs
Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we can inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages available to Emacs.
@end table

@node Target Audience
@chapter Target Audience

Org-roam is a tool that will appear unfriendly to anyone unfamiliar with Emacs
and Org-mode, but is also extremely powerful to those willing to put effort in
mastering the intricacies of the tools. Org-roam stands on the shoulders on
giants. Emacs was first created in 1976, and remains a top tier tool for editing
text and designing textual interfaces. The malleability of Emacs allowed the
creation of Org-mode, an all-purpose plain-text system for maintaining TODO
lists, planning projects, and authoring documents. Both of these tools are
incredibly vast and require significant time investment to master.

Org-roam assumes basic familiarity with these tools. It is not difficult to get
up and running with basic text-editing functionality, but one will only fully
appreciate the power of building Roam functionality into Emacs and Org-mode when
the usage of these tools become more advanced.

One key advantage to Org-roam is that building on top of Emacs gives it
malleability. This is especially important for note-taking workflows. It is our
belief that note-taking workflows are extremely personal, and there is no one
tool that's perfect for you. Org-mode and Org-roam allows you to discover what
works for you, and build that perfect tool for yourself.

If you are new to the software, and choose to take this leap of faith, I hope
you find yourself equally entranced as Neal Stephenson was.

@quotation
Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that
the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply
makes everything else vanish. – Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the
Command Line (1998)

@node A Brief Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method
@chapter A Brief Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method

Org-roam provides utilities for maintaining a digital slip-box. This section
aims to provide a brief introduction to the ``slip-box'', or ``Zettelkasten''
method. By providing some background on the method, we hope that the design
decisions of Org-roam will become clear, and that will aid in using Org-roam
appropriately. In this section we will also introduce terms commonly used within
the Zettelkasten community, which will also commonly appear in the Org-roam
forums and channels of discussion.

The Zettelkasten method of note-taking is designed to increase research
productivity: in particular, it acts as a research partner, where conversations
with it may produce new and surprising lines of thought. This method is
attributed to German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who using the method had
produced volumes of written works.

In its paper form, the slip-box is simply a box of cards. These cards are small
-- often only large enough to fit a single concept. The size limitation
encourages ideas to be broken down into individual concepts. These ideas are
explicitly linked together. The breakdown of ideas encourages tangential
exploration of ideas, increasing the surface for thought. Making linking
explicit between notes also encourages one to think about the connections
between concepts.

Org-roam is the slip-box, digitalized in Org-mode. Every zettel (card) is a
plain-text, Org-mode file. These files are often placed in the same directory.
In the same way one would maintain a paper slip-box, Org-roam makes it easy to
create new zettels, pre-filling boilerplate content using a powerful templating
system. Org-roam also facilitates the linking of zettels using Org-mode @code{file:}
links.

A slip-box requires a method of quickly capturing ideas. These are called
@strong{fleeting notes}: they are simple reminders of information or ideas that will
need to be processed later on, or trashed. This is typically accomplished using
@code{org-capture} (see @ref{capture,,,org,}), or using Org-roam's daily notes
functionality (see @ref{Daily Notes}). This provides a central inbox for collecting
thoughts, to be processed later into permanent notes.

Permanent notes are further split into two categories: @strong{literature notes} and
@strong{concept notes}. Literature notes can be brief annotations on a particular
source (e.g. book, website or paper), that you'd like to access later on.
Concept notes require much more care in authoring: they need to be
self-explanatory and detailed. Org-roam's templating system supports the
addition of different templates to facilitate the creation of these notes.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Org-roam can be installed using Emacs' package manager or manually from its
development repository.

@end menu

@node Installing from MELPA
@section Installing from MELPA

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven't used Emacs'
package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by reading the
documentation in the Emacs manual, see @ref{Packages,,,emacs,}. Then, add one of the
archives to @samp{package-archives}:

@itemize
@item
To use Melpa:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
@end lisp

@itemize
@item
To use Melpa-Stable:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
@end lisp

Org-roam also depends on a recent version of Org, which can be obtained in Org's
package repository (see @ref{Installation,,,org,}). To use Org's ELPA archive:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
@end lisp

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

@example
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
@end example

Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its dependencies
using:

@example
M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
@end example

Now see @ref{Post-Installation Tasks}.

@node Installing from Apt
@section Installing from Apt

Users of Debian 11 or later or Ubuntu 20.10 or later can simply install Org-roam
using Apt:

@example
apt-get install elpa-org-roam
@end example

Org-roam will then be autoloaded into Emacs.

@node Installing from the Git Repository
@section @strong{TODO} Installing from the Git Repository

@node Post-Installation Tasks
@section Post-Installation Tasks

Org-roam uses @code{emacsql-sqlite3}, which requires @code{sqlite3} to be located on
@code{exec-path}. Please ensure that @code{sqlite3} is installed appropriately on your
operating system. You can verify that this is the case by executing:

@lisp
(executable-find "sqlite3")
@end lisp

If you have @code{sqlite3} installed, and @code{executable-find} still reports @code{nil}, then
it is likely that the path to the executable is not a member of the Emacs
variable @code{exec-path}. You may rectify this by manually adding the path within
your Emacs configuration:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'exec-path "path/to/sqlite3")
@end lisp

@node Getting Started
@chapter Getting Started

This short tutorial describes the essential commands used in Org-roam, to help
you get started.

First, it is important to understand how Org-roam was designed. Org-roam was
built to support a workflow that was not possible with vanilla Org-mode. This
flow is modelled after the @uref{https://zettelkasten.de/, Zettelkasten Method}, and many of @uref{https://roamresearch.com, Roam Research's}
workflows. Org-roam does not magically make note-taking better -- this often
requires a radical change in your current note-taking workflow. To understand
more about the methods and madness, see @ref{Note-taking Workflows}.

To first start using Org-roam, one needs to pick a location to store the
Org-roam files. The directory that will contain your notes, and database index
is specified by the variable @code{org-roam-directory}. This variable needs to be set
before any calls to Org-roam functions, including enabling @code{org-roam-mode}. For
this tutorial, create an empty directory, and set @code{org-roam-directory}:

@lisp
(make-directory "~/org-roam")
(setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")
@end lisp

We encourage using a flat hierarchy for storing notes, but some prefer using
folders for storing specific kinds of notes (e.g. websites, papers). This is
fine; Org-roam searches recursively within @code{org-roam-directory} for any notes.
Instead of relying on the file hierarchy for any form of categorization, we
solely rely on links between files to establish connections between notes.

Next, we need to enable the global minor mode @code{org-roam-mode}. This sets up Emacs
with several hooks, builds a cache and keeps it consistent. We recommend
starting @code{org-roam-mode} on startup:

@lisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)
@end lisp

To build the cache manually, one can run @code{M-x org-roam-db-build-cache}. The
cache is a sqlite database named @code{org-roam.db}, which defaults to residing in
the root @code{org-roam-directory}. Cache builds may take a while the first time, but
is often instantaneous in subsequent runs.

Let us now create our first note. Call @code{M-x org-roam-find-file}. This shows a list
of titles for notes that reside in @code{org-roam-directory}. It should show nothing
right now, since there are no notes in the directory. Entering the title of the
note you wish to create, and pressing @code{RET} should begin the note creation
process. This process uses @code{org-capture}'s templating system, and can be freely
customized (see @ref{The Templating System}). Using the default template, pressing @code{C-c
C-c} finishes the note capture. Running @code{M-x org-roam-find-file} again should show
the note you have created, and selecting that entry will bring you to that note.

The crux of Org-roam is making it easy to create notes, and link them together.
To link notes together, we call @code{M-x org-roam-insert}. This brings up a prompt
with a list of title for existing notes. Selecting an existing entry will create
and insert a link to the current file. Entering a non-existent title will create
a new note with that title. Good usage of Org-roam requires liberally linking
files: this facilitates building up a dense knowledge graph of inter-connected
notes.

Org-roam provides an interface to view backlinks. It shows backlinks for the
currently active Org-roam note, along with some surrounding context. To toggle
the visibility of this buffer, call @code{M-x org-roam}.

For a visual representation of the notes and their connections, Org-roam also
provides graphing capabilities, using Graphviz. It generates graphs with notes
as nodes, and links between them as edges. The generated graph can be used to
navigate to the files, but this requires some additional setup (see @ref{Roam Protocol, , Roam
Protocol}).

@node Anatomy of an Org-roam File
@chapter Anatomy of an Org-roam File

The bulk of Org-roam's functionality is built on top of vanilla
Org-mode. However, to support additional functionality, Org-roam adds
several Org-roam-specific keywords. These functionality are not crucial
to effective use of Org-roam.

@menu
* Titles::
* Tags::
* File Refs::
@end menu

@node Titles
@section Titles

To easily find a note, a title needs to be prescribed to a note. A note can have
many titles: this allows a note to be referred to by different names, which is
especially useful for topics or concepts with acronyms. For example, for a note
like ``World War 2'', it may be desirable to also refer to it using the acronym
``WWII''.

Org-roam calls @code{org-roam--extract-titles} to extract titles. It uses the
variable @code{org-roam-title-sources}, to control how the titles are extracted. The
title extraction methods supported are:

@enumerate
@item
@code{'title}: This extracts the title using the file @code{#+title} property
@item
@code{'headline}: This extracts the title from the first headline in the Org file
@item
@code{'alias}: This extracts a list of titles using the @code{#+roam_alias} property.
The aliases are space-delimited, and can be multi-worded using quotes
@end enumerate

Take for example the following org file:

@example
#+title: World War 2
#+roam_alias: "WWII" "World War II"

* Headline
@end example

@multitable {aaaaaaaaaaa} {aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}
@headitem Method
@tab Titles
@item @code{'title}
@tab '(``World War 2'')
@item @code{'headline}
@tab '(``Headline'')
@item @code{'alias}
@tab '(``WWII'' ``World War II'')
@end multitable

One can freely control which extraction methods to use by customizing
@code{org-roam-title-sources}: see the doc-string for the variable for more
information. If all methods of title extraction return no results, the file-name
is used in place of the titles for completions.

If you wish to add your own title extraction method, you may push a symbol
@code{'foo} into @code{org-roam-title-sources}, and define a
@code{org-roam--extract-titles-foo} which accepts no arguments. See
@code{org-roam--extract-titles-title} for an example.

@node Tags
@section Tags

Tags are used as meta-data for files: they facilitate interactions with notes
where titles are insufficient. For example, tags allow for categorization of
notes: differentiating between bibliographical and structure notes during interactive commands.

Org-roam calls @code{org-roam--extract-tags} to extract tags from files. It uses the
variable @code{org-roam-tag-sources}, to control how tags are extracted. The tag
extraction methods supported are:

@enumerate
@item
@code{'prop}: This extracts tags from the @code{#+roam_tags} property. Tags are space delimited, and can be multi-word using double quotes.
@item
@code{'all-directories}: All sub-directories relative to @code{org-roam-directory} are
extracted as tags. That is, if a file is located at relative path
@code{foo/bar/file.org}, the file will have tags @code{foo} and @code{bar}.
@item
@code{'last-directory}: Extracts the last directory relative to
@code{org-roam-directory} as the tag. That is, if a file is located at relative
path @code{foo/bar/file.org}, the file will have tag @code{bar}.
@item
@code{'first-directory}: Extracts the first directory relative to
@code{org-roam-directory} as the tag. That is, if a file is located at relative
path @code{foo/bar/file.org}, the file will have tag @code{foo}.
@end enumerate

By default, only the @code{'prop} extraction method is enabled. To enable the other
extraction methods, you may modify @code{org-roam-tag-sources}:

@lisp
(setq org-roam-tag-sources '(prop last-directory))
@end lisp

If you wish to add your own tag extraction method, you may push a symbol @code{'foo}
into @code{org-roam-tag-sources}, and define a @code{org-roam--extract-tags-foo} which
accepts the absolute file path as its argument. See
@code{org-roam--extract-tags-prop} for an example.

@node File Refs
@section File Refs

Refs are unique identifiers for files. Each note can only have 1 ref.
For example, a note for a website may contain a ref:

@example
#+title: Google
#+roam_key: https://www.google.com/
@end example

These keys come in useful for when taking website notes, using the
@code{roam-ref} protocol (see @ref{Roam Protocol}).

Alternatively, add a ref for notes for a specific paper, using its
@uref{https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref, org-ref} citation key:

@example
#+title: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
#+roam_key: cite:chen18_neural_ordin_differ_equat
@end example

The backlinks buffer will show any cites of this key: e.g.

@float Figure
@image{images/org-ref-citelink,,,,png}
@caption{org-ref-citelink}
@end float

@node The Templating System
@chapter The Templating System

Rather than creating blank files on @code{org-roam-insert} and @code{org-roam-find-file},
it may be desirable to prefill the file with templated content. This may
include:

@itemize
@item
Time of creation
@item
File it was created from
@item
Clipboard content
@item
Any other data you may want to input manually
@end itemize

This requires a complex template insertion system. Fortunately, Org ships with a
powerful one: @code{org-capture} (see @ref{capture,,,org,}). However, org-capture was not
designed for such use. Org-roam abuses @code{org-capture}, extending its syntax and
capabilities. To first understand how org-roam's templating system works, it may
be useful to look into basic usage of @code{org-capture}.

For these reasons, Org-roam capture templates are not compatible with regular
@code{org-capture}. Hence, Org-roam's templates can be customized by instead
modifying the variable @code{org-roam-capture-templates}. Just like
@code{org-capture-templates}, @code{org-roam-capture-templates} can contain multiple
templates. If @code{org-roam-capture-templates} only contains one template, there
will be no prompt for template selection.

@menu
* Template Walkthrough::
* Org-roam Template Expansion::
@end menu

@node Template Walkthrough
@section Template Walkthrough

To demonstrate the additions made to org-capture templates. Here, we walkthrough
the default template, reproduced below.

@lisp
("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
     "%?"
     :file-name "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-$@{slug@}"
     :head "#+title: $@{title@}\n"
     :unnarrowed t)
@end lisp

@enumerate
@item
The template has short key @code{"d"}. If you have only one template,
org-roam automatically chooses this template for you.
@item
The template is given a description of @code{"default"}.
@item
@code{plain} text is inserted. Other options include Org headings via
@code{entry}.
@item
@code{(function org-roam--capture-get-point)} should not be changed.
@item
@code{"%?"} is the template inserted on each call to @code{org-roam-capture--capture}.
This template means don't insert any content, but place the cursor
here.
@item
@code{:file-name} is the file-name template for a new note, if it doesn't yet
exist. This creates a file at path that looks like
@code{/path/to/org-roam-directory/20200213032037-foo.org}. This template also
allows you to specify if you want the note to go into a subdirectory. For
example, the template @code{private/$@{slug@}} will create notes in
@code{/path/to/org-roam-directory/private}.
@item
@code{:head} contains the initial template to be inserted (once only), at
the beginning of the file. Here, the title global attribute is
inserted.
@item
@code{:unnarrowed t} tells org-capture to show the contents for the whole
file, rather than narrowing to just the entry.
@end enumerate

Other options you may want to learn about include @code{:immediate-finish}.

@node Org-roam Template Expansion
@section Org-roam Template Expansion

Org-roam's template definitions also extend org-capture's template syntax, to
allow prefilling of strings. We have seen a glimpse of this in @ref{Template Walkthrough, , Template
Walkthrough}.

In org-roam templates, the @code{$@{var@}} syntax allows for the expansion of
variables, stored in @code{org-roam-capture--info}. For example, during
@code{org-roam-insert}, the user is prompted for a title. Upon entering a
non-existent title, the @code{title} key in @code{org-roam-capture--info} is set to the
provided title. @code{$@{title@}} is then expanded into the provided title during the
org-capture process. Any variables that do not contain strings, are prompted for
values using @code{completing-read}.

After doing this expansion, the org-capture's template expansion system
is used to fill up the rest of the template. You may read up more on
this on @uref{https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion, org-capture's documentation page}.

To illustrate this dual expansion process, take for example the template string:
@code{"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-$@{title@}"}, with the title @code{"Foo"}. The template is first
expanded into @code{%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-Foo}. Then org-capture expands @code{%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>}
with timestamp: e.g. @code{20200213032037-Foo}.

All of the flexibility afforded by Emacs and Org-mode are available. For
example, if you want to encode a UTC timestamp in the filename, you can take
advantage of org-mode's @code{%(EXP)} template expansion to call @code{format-time-string}
directly to provide its third argument to specify UTC@.

@lisp
("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
     "%?"
     :file-name "%(format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%SZ--$@{slug@}\" (current-time) t)"
     :head "#+title: $@{title@}\n"
     :unnarrowed t)
@end lisp

@node Concepts and Configuration
@chapter Concepts and Configuration

The number of configuration options is deliberately kept small, to keep
the Org-roam codebase manageable. However, we attempt to accommodate as
many usage styles as possible.

All of Org-roam's customization options can be viewed via

To distinguish between org-roam links and regular links, one may choose to use
special indicators for Org-roam links. Defaults to @code{"%s"}.

If your version of Org is at least @code{9.2}, consider styling the link differently,
by customizing the @code{org-roam-link}, and @code{org-roam-link-current} faces.

@node Index File
@section Index File

As your collection grows, you might want to create an index where you keep links
to your main files.

In Org-roam, you can define the path to your index file by setting
@code{org-roam-index-file}.

@itemize
@item
Variable: org-roam-index-file

Path to the Org-roam index file.

The path can be a string or a function. If it is a string, it should be the
path (absolute or relative to @code{org-roam-directory}) to the index file. If it
is is a function, the function should return the path to the index file.
Otherwise, the index is assumed to be a note in @code{org-roam-index} whose
title is @code{"Index"}.

@item
Function: org-roam-find-index

Opens the Index file in the current @code{org-roam-directory}.
@end itemize

@node Encryption
@chapter Encryption

One may wish to keep private, encrypted files. Org-roam supports encryption (via
GPG), which can be enabled for all new files by setting @code{org-roam-encrypt-files}
to @code{t}. When enabled, new files are created with the @code{.org.gpg} extension and
decryption are handled automatically by EasyPG@.

Note that Emacs will prompt for a password for encrypted files during
cache updates if it requires reading the encrypted file. To reduce the
number of password prompts, you may wish to cache the password.

@itemize
@item
Variable: org-roam-encrypt-files

Whether to encrypt new files.  If true, create files with .org.gpg extension.
@end itemize

@node Graphing
@chapter Graphing

Org-roam provides graphing capabilities to explore interconnections between
notes. This is done by performing SQL queries and generating images using
@uref{https://graphviz.org/, Graphviz}. The graph can also be navigated: see @ref{Roam Protocol}.

The entry point to graph creation is @code{org-roam-graph}.

@itemize
@item
Function: org-roam-graph & optional arg file node-query

Build and possibly display a graph for FILE from NODE-QUERY@.
If FILE is nil, default to current buffer’s file name.
ARG may be any of the following values:

@itemize
@item
@code{nil}       show the graph.
@item
@code{C-u}       show the graph for FILE@.
@item
@code{C-u N}     show the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.
@item
@code{C-u C-u}   build the graph.
@item
@code{C-u -}     build the graph for FILE@.
@item
@code{C-u -N}    build the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.
@end itemize

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-executable

Path to the graphing executable (in this case, Graphviz). Set this if Org-roam is unable to find the Graphviz executable on your system.

You may also choose to use @code{neato} in place of @code{dot}, which generates a more
compact graph layout.

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-viewer

Org-roam defaults to using Firefox (located on PATH) to view the SVG, but you may choose to set it to:

@enumerate
@item
A string, which is a path to the program used
@item
a function accepting a single argument: the graph file path.
@end enumerate

@code{nil} uses @code{view-file} to view the graph.

If you are using WSL2 and would like to open the graph in Windows, you can use the second option to set the browser and network file path:

@lisp
(setq org-roam-graph-viewer
    (lambda (file)
      (let ((org-roam-graph-viewer "/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe"))
        (org-roam-graph--open (concat "file://///wsl$/Ubuntu" file)))))

Graphviz provides many options for customizing the graph output, and Org-roam supports some of them. See @uref{https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/attrs.html} for customizable options.

@itemize
@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-extra-config

Extra options passed to graphviz for the digraph (The ``G'' attributes).
Example: @code{'~(("rankdir" . "LR"))}

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-node-extra-config

Extra options for nodes in the graphviz output (The ``N'' attributes).
Example: @code{'(("color" . "skyblue"))}

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-extra-config

Extra options for edges in the graphviz output (The ``E'' attributes).
Example: @code{'(("dir" . "back"))}

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-edge-cites-extra-config

Extra options for citation edges in the graphviz output.
Example: @code{'(("color" . "red"))}
@end itemize

@node Excluding Nodes and Edges
@section Excluding Nodes and Edges

One may want to exclude certain files to declutter the graph.

@itemize
@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher

Matcher for excluding nodes from the generated graph. Any nodes and links for
file paths matching this string is excluded from the graph.

If value is a string, the string is the only matcher.

If value is a list, all file paths matching any of the strings
are excluded.
@end itemize

@example
(setq org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher '("private" "dailies"))
@end example

This setting excludes all files whose path contain ``private'' or ``dailies''.

@node Org-roam Completion System
@chapter Org-roam Completion System

Org-roam allows customization of which minibuffer completion system to use for
its interactive commands. The default setting uses Emacs' standard
@code{completing-read} mechanism.

@lisp
(setq org-roam-completion-system 'default)
@end lisp

If you have installed Helm or Ivy, and have their modes enabled, under the
@code{'default} setting they will be used.

In the rare scenario where you use Ivy globally, but prefer @uref{https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/, Helm} for org-roam
commands, set:

@lisp
(setq org-roam-completion-system 'helm)

Org-roam extending @code{org-protocol} with 2 protocols: the @code{roam-file}
and @code{roam-ref} protocol.

@node Installation (1)
@section Installation

To enable Org-roam's protocol extensions, you have to add the following to your init file:

@lisp
(require 'org-roam-protocol)
@end lisp

The instructions for setting up @code{org-protocol} are reproduced below.

We will also need to create a desktop application for @code{emacsclient}. The
instructions for various platforms are shown below.

For Linux users, create a desktop application in @code{~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop}:

@example
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Org-Protocol
Exec=emacsclient %u
Icon=emacs-icon
Type=Application
Terminal=false
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
@end example

Associate @code{org-protocol://} links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

@example
xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
@end example

To disable the ``confirm'' prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the @code{Org-Protocol Client} app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

@example
sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
@{
  "ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox": true
@}
EOF
sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json
@end example

and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to <chrome://restart>) to
make the new policy take effect.

See @uref{https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start, here} for more info on the @code{/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed} directory and
@uref{https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox, here} for information on the @code{ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox} policy.

For MacOS, one solution is to use @uref{https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus, Platypus}. Here are the instructions for
setting up with Platypus and Chrome:

@enumerate
@item
Install and launch Platypus (with @uref{https://brew.sh/, Homebrew}):
@end enumerate

@example
brew cask install platypus
@end example

@enumerate
@item
Create a script @code{launch_emacs.sh}:
@end enumerate

@example
#!/usr/bin/env bash
/usr/local/bin/emacsclient --no-wait $1
@end example

@enumerate
@item
Create a Platypus app with the following settings:
@end enumerate

@example
| Setting                        | Value                     |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------|
| App Name                       | "OrgProtocol"             |
| Script Type                    | "env" · "/usr/bin/env"    |
| Script Path                    | "path/to/launch-emacs.sh" |
| Interface                      | None                      |
| Accept dropped items           | true                      |
| Remain running after execution | false                     |
@end example


Inside @code{Settings}:

@example
| Setting                        | Value          |
|--------------------------------+----------------|
| Accept dropped files           | true           |
| Register as URI scheme handler | true           |
| Protocol                       | "org-protocol" |
@end example

To disable the ``confirm'' prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the @code{OrgProtocol} app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

@example
defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true
@end example


If you're using @uref{https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport, Emacs Mac Port}, it registered its `Emacs.app` as the default
handler for the URL scheme `org-protocol`. To make @code{OrgProtocol.app}
the default handler instead, run:

@example
defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
'@{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = @{ "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; @}; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";@}'
@end example

Then restart your computer.

For Windows, create a temporary @code{org-protocol.reg} file:

@example
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol]
@@="URL:Org Protocol"
"URL Protocol"=""
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open\command]
@@="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe\" emacsclient \"%1\""
@end example

The above will forward the protocol to WSL@. If you run Emacs natively on Windows, replace the last line with:

@example
@@="\"c:\\path\\to\\emacs\\bin\\emacsclientw.exe\"  \"%1\""
@end example

After executing the .reg file, the protocol is registered and you can delete the file.

@node The roam-file protocol
@section The roam-file protocol

This is a simple protocol that opens the path specified by the @code{file}
key (e.g. @code{org-protocol://roam-file?file=/tmp/file.org}). This is used
in the generated graph.

@node The roam-ref protocol
@section The roam-ref protocol

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given @code{roam_key} (see @ref{Anatomy of an Org-roam File}):

@image{images/roam-ref,,,,gif}

To use this, create the following @uref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet, bookmarklet} in your browser:

@example
javascript:location.href =
'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
+ encodeURIComponent(location.href)
+ '&title='
+ encodeURIComponent(document.title)
@end example

or as a keybinding in @code{qutebrowser} in , using the @code{config.py} file (see
@uref{https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc, Configuring qutebrowser}):

@example
config.bind("<Ctrl-r>", "open javascript:location.href='org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)")
@end example

where @code{template} is the template key for a template in
@code{org-roam-capture-ref-templates} (see @ref{The Templating System}). These templates
should contain a @code{#+roam_key: $@{ref@}} in it.

@node Diagnosing and Repairing Files
@chapter Diagnosing and Repairing Files

Org-roam provides a utility for diagnosing and repairing problematic files via
@code{org-roam-doctor}. By default, @code{org-roam-doctor} runs the check on the current
Org-roam file. To run the check only for the current file, run @code{C-u M-x
org-roam-doctor}, but note that this may take some time.

@itemize
@item
Function: org-roam-doctor &optional this-buffer

Perform a check on Org-roam files to ensure cleanliness. If THIS-BUFFER, run
the check only for the current buffer.
@end itemize

The checks run are defined in @code{org-roam-doctor--checkers}. Each checker is an
instance of @code{org-roam-doctor-checker}. To define a checker, use
@code{make-org-roam-doctor-checker}. Here is a sample definition:

@lisp
(make-org-roam-doctor-checker
    :name 'org-roam-doctor-broken-links
    :description "Fix broken links."
    :actions '(("d" . ("Unlink" . org-roam-doctor--remove-link))
               ("r" . ("Replace link" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link))
               ("R" . ("Replace link (keep label)" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link-keep-label))))
@end lisp

The @code{:name} property is the name of the function run. The function takes in the
Org parse tree, and returns a list of @code{(point error-message)}. @code{:description} is a
short description of what the checker does. @code{:actions} is an alist containing
elements of the form @code{(char . (prompt . function))}. These actions are defined per
checker, to perform autofixes for the errors. For each error detected,
@code{org-roam-doctor} will move the point to the current error, and pop-up a help
window displaying the error message, as well as the list of actions that can be
taken provided in @code{:actions}.

@node Browsing History with winner-mode
@subsection Browsing History with winner-mode

@code{winner-mode} is a global minor mode that allows one to undo and redo changes in the window configuration. It is included with GNU Emacs since version 20.

@code{winner-mode} can be used as a simple version of browser history for Org-roam. Each click through org-roam links (from both Org files and the backlinks buffer) causes changes in window configuration, which can be undone and redone using @code{winner-mode}. To use @code{winner-mode}, simply enable it, and bind the appropriate interactive functions:

@lisp
(winner-mode +1)
(define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-left>") #'winner-undo)
(define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-right>") #'winner-redo)

@end lisp

@node Versioning Notes
@subsection Versioning Notes

Since Org-roam notes are just plain text, it is trivial to track changes in your
notes database using version control systems such as @uref{https://git-scm.com/, Git}. Simply initialize
@code{org-roam-directory} as a Git repository, and commit your files at regular or
appropriate intervals. @uref{https://magit.vc/, Magit} is a great interface to Git within Emacs.

In addition, it may be useful to observe how a particular note has evolved, by
looking at the file history. @uref{https://gitlab.com/pidu/git-timemachine, Git-timemachine} allows you to visit historic
versions of a tracked Org-roam note.

@node Full-text search interface with Deft
@subsection Full-text search interface with Deft

@uref{https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/, Deft} provides a nice interface for browsing and filtering org-roam notes.

@lisp
(use-package deft
  :after org
  :bind
  ("C-c n d" . deft)
  :custom
  (deft-recursive t)
  (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
  (deft-default-extension "org")
  (deft-directory "/path/to/org-roam-files/"))
@end lisp

If the title of the Org file is not the first line, you might not get
nice titles. You may choose to patch this to use @code{org-roam}'s
functionality. Here I'm using
@uref{https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch, el-patch}:

@lisp
(use-package el-patch
  :straight (:host github
                   :repo "raxod502/el-patch"
                   :branch "develop"))

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'el-patch))

(use-package deft
  ;; same as above...
  :config/el-patch
  (defun deft-parse-title (file contents)
    "Parse the given FILE and CONTENTS and determine the title.
If `deft-use-filename-as-title' is nil, the title is taken to
be the first non-empty line of the FILE.  Else the base name of the FILE is
used as title."
    (el-patch-swap (if deft-use-filename-as-title
                       (deft-base-filename file)
                     (let ((begin (string-match "^.+$" contents)))
                       (if begin
                           (funcall deft-parse-title-function
                                    (substring contents begin (match-end 0))))))
                   (org-roam--get-title-or-slug file))))
@end lisp

The Deft interface can slow down quickly when the number of files get
huge. @uref{https://github.com/hasu/notdeft, Notdeft} is a fork of Deft

@node How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?
@section How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?

Emacs supports directory-local variables, allowing the value of
@code{org-roam-directory} to be different in different directories. It does this by
checking for a file named @code{.dir-locals.el}.

To add support for multiple directories, override the @code{org-roam-directory}
variable using directory-local variables. This is what @code{.dir-locals.el} may
contain:

@lisp
((nil . ((org-roam-directory . ".")
         (org-roam-db-location . "./org-roam.db"))))
@end lisp

All files within that directory will be treated as their own separate
set of Org-roam files. Remember to run @code{org-roam-db-build-cache} from a
file within that directory, at least once.
